\begin{frame}[c]{Battery Classification}
\bbi
\item Primary Cells: Cannot be recharged as the chemical reactions cannot be reversed.
\item Secondary Cells: Can be recharged by passing a current through the cell in the opposite direction.

\begin{frame}[c]{Battery Chemistries: Lead-Acid Battery }
\bbi   
\item Type: secondary cell
\item Chemistry: lead, lead dioxide, electrolyte concentrated sulfuric acid
\item Pros: High energy density, many recharge cycles, cheap
\item Cons: Effectiveness reduced at low temperatures, self-discharge, contains lead 
\item Voltage: 2V per cell
\item Usage: vehicle starter and ignition, backup power supplies
\item Oldest type of rechargable battery (invented in 1859)

\begin{frame}[c]{Battery Chemistries: NiCd }
\bbi   
\item Type: secondary cell
\item Chemistry: 
\item Pros: long shelf life, many recharge cycles, good performance at low temperatures, can produce large instantaneous currents (1000-8000A for one second)
\item Cons: contains cadmium (heavy, expensive and toxic), corrosive electrolyte
\item Voltage: 1.2V per cell
\item Usage: portable electronic equipment e.g. flash lights, aircraft and satellite electrical systems, starting large diesel engines and turbines

\begin{frame}[c]{Fuel Cells}
\bbi 
\item Galvanic cell where the fuel and an oxidant are continuously supplied from the outside and west products are removed as they are formed. 
\item Pros: high-efficiency of energy conversion, no harmful waste products, no need to recharge 
\item Cons: expensive, fuel gases must be stored in high-pressure tanks, moderate power output
\item Use: the space shuttle, military submarines
