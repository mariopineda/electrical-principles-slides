\begin{frame}[c]{Objectives}
\bbi
\item Describe the major features of cells
\item Know the two major types of cells
\ei
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Battery Classification}
\bbi
\item Primary Cells: Cannot be recharged as the chemical reactions cannot be reversed.
\item Secondary Cells: Can be recharged by passing a current through the cell in the opposite direction.
\ei
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Battery Chemistries: Lithium Polymer (LiPo)}
\bbi
\item Type: Secondary cell
\item Chemistry: Lithium-ion and polymer (gel) electrolyte
\item Pros: High energy content, light, can be produced in any shape
\item Cons: Physical damage, over charge or too high temperature can cause cells to fail catastrophically (fire, explosion)
\item Voltage: 2.7-4.2V
\item Usage: personal electronics (laptops, cell phones), RC vehicles, International Space Station (since 2017)
\item Invented by Sony in 1991
\ei
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Battery Chemistries: Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4 aka LFP)}
\bbi
\item Type: Secondary cell
\item Chemistry: 
\item Pros: Constant discharge voltage, stable and safe (compare to LiPo), many recharge cycles
\item Cons: Lower energy density 
\item Voltage: 3.2V per cell
\item Usage: Electric vehicles, power tools, RC vehicles
\ei
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Battery Chemistries: Lead-Acid Battery}
\bi
\item Type: Secondary cell
\item Chemistry: Lead, lead dioxide, electrolyte concentrated sulfuric acid
\item Pros: High energy density, many recharge cycles, cheap
\item Cons: Effectiveness reduced at low temperatures, self-discharges, contains lead and concentrated sulfuric acid
\item Voltage: 2V per cell
\item Usage: Vehicle starter and ignition, backup power supplies (computer UPS units)
\item Oldest type of rechargable 
\ei
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Battery Chemistries: NiCd }
\bi
\item Type: Secondary cell
\item Chemistry:
\item Pros: Long Shelf life,many recharge cycles, good performance at low temperatures, can produce very large instantaneous currents (1000-8000A for a second) 
\item Cons: Contains Cadmium (heavy, expensive and toxic), corrosive electrolytes
\item Voltage: 1.2V per cell
\item Usage: Portable electronic equipment, e.g. flash lights, aircraft and satellite systems, starting large disel engines and turbines.
\ei
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Battery Chemistries: Nickel-metal Hydride (NiMH)}
\bi
\item Type: Secondary cell
\item Chemistry: 
\item Pros:
\item Cons: Overcharging can rupture 
\item Voltage: 1.4-1.6V
\item Usage: Consumer electronics
\ei
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Fuel Cells}
\bi
\item Fuel and oxidant are continuously supplied from the outise while vaste products are removed.
\item Pros: High-efficiency of energy conversion, no harmful waste products, no need to recharge
\item Cons: Expensive, fuel gases must be stored in high-pressure tanks, moderate power output
\item Use: The space shuttle and Apollo space program, military submarines
